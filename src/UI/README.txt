UI Layer

The UI Layer contains user-facing components, such as admin dashboards or shortcode views.

Purpose:
- Expose the applicationâ€™s functionality to end-users or WordPress administrators.
- Display data and provide interfaces to manage the queue.

Contents:
- Admin/: Contains admin pages like the task management dashboard.
- Templates/: (Optional) For rendering HTML views.

Why:
- Keeps the presentation layer separate from the application logic.
- Ensures the UI is flexible and easy to extend.
